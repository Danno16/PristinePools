<p class="p6">WHY CHOOSE US?  </p>

<p class="p4">  Pristine Pools and Spa Service wants you to have a pool experience that you can enjoy without having to deal 
                with all the stress of maintaining it. We promise to treat you with honor and integrity while providing you with
                an excellent service. We would be honored to have your business! </p>
<p></p>
<p class="p4"> We will care for your pool as if it were our own! We will use our 8 point system to make the pool ready to enjoy.
                We will not provide you with a pool that we would not swim in ourselves. </p>

<p class="p6">WHY CHOOSE US?  </p>

<p class="p4">  At Pristine Pools and Spa Service you will always get a friendly professional attitude. We will treat you and 
                your property with the utmost respect. We will make every effort to make sure you are fully satisfied with the
                services we are providing. When we are at your property you and your pool are our number one priority and will 
                receive 100% of our attention.  </p>

<p class="p6">WE ARE RELIABLE  </p>

<p class="p4">  Two of the biggest complaints we hear are "I don't even know if my pool guy shows up" or "My pool guy is in and 
                out in 5 minutes, did he even clean my pool?" These will never be statements you make when you use with 
                Pristine Pools and Spa Service.   </p>
<p></p>
<p class="p4">  We will email you every time we service your pool with a description of what was done during that visit. This will
                give you the security of knowing you are doing business with someone you can trust.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="p4">  We will take as much time as your pool needs to make sure it is functioning at its fullest capacity, because 
                perfection cannot be rushed. Unlike some of our competitors we take the time to get to know your pool, because 
                each pool has a different personality and needs to be treated that way.  </p>

<p class="p6">WE UNDERSTAND WATER CHEMISTRY </p>

<p class="p4">  Pristine Pools and Spa Service we understand the importance of water chemistry. We understand that the average 
                pool owner is not professionally trained on proper pool water chemistry and we are here to help. Sure, you can 
                take a pool water sample to a local retail pool store, but unfortunately this is not always an acceptable way to 
                handle the balancing of your pool water.   </p>    
                
<p></p>
<p class="p4">  There are so many factors that go into determining the correct water chemistry for your particular pool. How can 
                the pool store employee really get a feel for what's wrong if he has never seen the pool himself? As it is stated 
                above, we take the time to get to know your particular pool and treat it individually. We have many customers that 
                have wasted a lot of time and money in expensive chemicals only to find out they were using them incorrectly and 
                they could not fix their problem. Why deal with the countless hours of stress of trying to figure it out yourself, 
                when you can hire a professional to take care of it for you? Allow us to let you just enjoy your pool for what it 
                should be, and that is a refreshing and relaxing getaway.  </p>
