    <p class="p4">        Pristine Pool and Spa Service is a local southern Utah pool cleaning and service company specializing 
      in maintaining and servicing residential swimming pools. Let us help you keep your pool clean and 
      serviced year round.  Proper maintenance of your pool not only extends the life of your swimming pool,
      but it also allows you and your family to fully enjoy the investment that you made. As part of our 
      service we regularly check and maintain your pool equipment. Unfortunately, with time there will
      eventually need to be repairs made to the equipment. Some common repairs are burnt out lights, 
      filter replacements, or pumps that  have gone bad. As a professional pool company we are able to get parts quickly and make professional
      repairs at low costs.</p>
